# Analyzing-IMDB-Movies
   Film production studios are continuously producing new films at an increasing rate.  Online streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime have also started producing their own movies. This huge increase in movie titles has given the consumer a wide variety of choices.
   
   This increase is a drawback to recommending movies to specific consumers and demographics.
We aim to solve this issue by applying data analysis to rank movies from a large database of movies.
